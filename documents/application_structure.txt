Initial file structure
======================

Pages
	index.html - basic html structure of the app

Templates
	restaurants.html - template for listing of restaurants
	menu.html - template for listing the menu of a restaurant
	info.html - template for restaurant specific information

Scripts
	application.js - application functionality common to all pages
	data.js - methods for communicating with the server api and handling local data
	restaurants.js - scripts for listing restaurants
	menu.js - scripts for listing a menu
	info.js - scripts for functionality on info page

Styles
	stylesheet.css

Business logic
==============

All application logic is implemented using JavaScript and jQuery Mobile. JavaScript application communicates to a public REST API already available at http://www.lounasaika.net/api/. For the basic functionality (show menus with location information) we don't need our own server backend at all.

Storage
=======

For application data storage we use local storage, making offline usage possible. Data needs to be refreshed from the api once a week.

HTML5 application
=================

Since all data will be fetched from a rest api or local storage, dynamic pages must be generated entirely using JavaScript. Basic html structure for each page will reside in template files. 

Application is navigated using jQuery Mobile url hashes. The logic for selecting page can use the pagebeforechange event. Example of a link in this application: <a href="#list-menu?restaurant=täffä">Täffä menu</a>.

See: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html

Templates will be populated with data using jQuery Mobile events. Delegate page forming functionality to 'pageinit/pagebeforeinit' events. After page is formed, event 'create' will be triggered.
