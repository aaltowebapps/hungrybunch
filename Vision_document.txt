Primary use cases:
==================
These use cases are mandatory for the application to work and to meet the user expectations.

Use case 3: As a user, I want to know where the restaurants are located.

Secondary use cases:
====================
These use cases are not mandatory for the application (or to pass the course) and can be done 
if there is time.

Use case 5: As a user, I want to see my favorite dishes.
